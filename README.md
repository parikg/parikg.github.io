**Brief Bio:** I am a machine learning researcher at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) where I work on the foundations of machine learning. My current interests focus on the interplay between fairness, loss minimization and indistinguishability. I am also interested in questions related to calibration, detecting and measuring distribution drift and anomaly detection. 

I have broad interests in theoretical comuter science, including topics such as coding and information theory, pseudorandomness and computational complexity. On the applied side, I have worked on systems for storing and interactively visualizing large datasets and anomaly detection.  

In the past, I have been a researcher at the [VMware Research Group](https://research.vmware.com/), [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) in Redmond and Silicon Valley, a graduate student at [Georgia Tech](https://aco.gatech.edu/) and an undergraduate at [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). See my [C.V.]() for more details.
