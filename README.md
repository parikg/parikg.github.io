I am a machine learning researcher at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/). I work on the foundations of machine learning, my current interests focus on the interplay between fairness, loss minimization and indistinguishability. I am also interested in questions realted to calibration, detecting and measuring distribution drift and anomaly detection.
